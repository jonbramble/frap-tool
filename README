			FRAP-TOOL
	Authors: Dr. Jonathan Bramble, Mr. Matthew Cheetham

FRAP-TOOL is a simple program to analyse images from FRAP experiments. 
For use in the MNP group at the University of Leeds. The images are assumed to
be tiff files generated by ImagePro Express software. 

ImagePro Express outputs incorrect datetime tiff tags and are parsed separately.
If your files are from a different program, this will have to be re-written 
accordingly.  


Usage: FRAP -p [background-image.tif] -c [closed-aperture.tif] [other-files.tif]
